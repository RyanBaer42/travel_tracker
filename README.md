# Travel Tracker


### Learning Goals:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Abstract:
Eat, Pray, Love, and do it all while tracking your past pending and future trips through Travel Tracker. Travel tracker stores your travel information and displays the amount you've spent on trips in the last year as well as the cost for any trip you send a pending request for. In the main section you get a nice visual of all trips that you have done in the past and upcoming trips you can look forward to. 


### Installation Instructions:
- Fork the repository found here: https://github.com/RyanBaer42/travel_tracker
- Clone down your new, forked repo. While cloning, name it what you want your local repo to be named, and run git clone.
- Next, do the same for the repository found here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api
- cd into the repository
- Install NPM packages in both repos by running npm install in your terminal
- Start the server by running npm start in your server repo and then start the server for the webpage as well
- After starting the server, the project will run at http://localhost:8080/

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Create get request associated with asynch functions(Promise.all) and display DOM elements during fetch requests. 
- Using iterators to filter find and create new data, then displaying that data to the user in meaningful ways. 

Some wins included:
- Deploying a login page that updates the user on whether the information is innacurate or redirects you to the main main if login information is correct. 
- Using single responsibility protocol for functions so that code is efficient and non-repetitive.
